This is a repo for 2019 Fall CPSC 5305 Team Project - Predict Diabetes with Demographics, Behaviors and Health Conditions

Diabetes is a considerable burden for patients and health insurance payers in the United States. Diabetes can lead to high medical bills, impaired physical mobility, and increased risk of sudden death, ultimately causing a decline in the quality of life of patients. The factors that cause diabetes are the complex effects of genes and acquired environments. Demographics and daily human behaviors, including diet, sleep, and exercise, are important environmental factors for diabetes. Additionally, current health conditions other than diabetes, such as cancers, CVD, as well as medications and treatments, can also have correlations with diabetes.

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for diabetes using demographics plus daily behaviors plus health conditions, then identify important variables in predicting diabetes. Finally, study the correlations between diabetes and important features. These important features could be valuable in further studies on causal relations.
